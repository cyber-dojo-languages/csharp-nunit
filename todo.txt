needs an output dir that contains red/amber/green sample outputs
that are used to test the red_amber_green lambda regex inside manifest.json

repo needs to set env-vars ${DOCKER_USERNAME} ${DOCKER_PASSWORD}

language_tester should have docker installed inside itself.
It can then build docker-image for the language as part of its script.
