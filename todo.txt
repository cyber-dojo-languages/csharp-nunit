See README.md

repo needs to set env-vars ${DOCKER_USERNAME} ${DOCKER_PASSWORD}

language_tester image is still based on foreman - change to sinatra

need to create a cyberdojo/base_ruby image
  cyberdojo/csharp_nunit_tester can be built from this
  cyberdojo/runner can be built from this
  cyberdojo/commander can be built from runner
